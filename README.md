# Tiny Doorbell Remote

Attiny powered RF remote for a wireless doorbell

## Hardware

![Schematic](hardware/schematic.png)

The hardware is built around the Attiny85 IC and a cheap [434 RF link transmitter](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10534).

A Fritzing schematic is in the [hardware](hardware) folder.

The circuit runs on a single 3V battery and consumes

- 65 Î¼A while on standby mode
- 7.5mA while transmitting

## Signal

The decoded signal for my doorbell was `0000111010011100` (or `0E9C` in hex). The original and replicated signal recordings are in the [signal-recordings](signal-recordings) folder. Open them with Audacity.

## API

There are some general guidelines and files in the [api](api) directory for creating a HTTP POST endpoint on a Raspberry Pi, to control the module via the web.
